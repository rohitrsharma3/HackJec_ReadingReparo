# HackJEC - ReadingReparo
Welcome to the official repository of Reading Reparo! 

## Our Solution
<p>
->A cross platform app which keeps the user occupied via gamification and allows them to read a vast -multilingual content <br>
->The score is given using MLâ€™s speech to text and text to speech API <br>
->Generating a sharable progress report and providing the reader an insight into their abilities <br>
->The idea of our implementation is to use Machine Learning algorithms to perform speech recognition and use open source libraries to examine the reading accuracy, while at the same time providing informative and engaging content from NCERT-DiSHA and inspirational biographies.  <br>
->Inclining the application towards a game like infrastructure by proving scores, coins and rewards which can be used to unlock cool avatars! <br>
->The accuracy is then used to derive a percentage score. <br>
->A DBMS powered by Firebase stores the scores of the user and generates a sharable progress report, providing the reader an insight into their abilities.
